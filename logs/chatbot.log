Hi
Hello
How are you feeling?
Not that great.
That's a real shame.
How are you?
I'm feeling a little down today.   
Not that great.
I guess we're all in the same boat then.
I guess we should talk about something else, then.
That's a wise decision.

How are you?
I'm fine
Do you like fish?
I like it a lot.
What don't you like about it?
I don't like its texture.                 
Who cares about the weather?
I care
Of course not.
No, I do.
Of course not.
I care about the weather as I don't like getting wet.
I guess we should talk about something else, then.
Good idea.
Bye

Hi
Hello
Do you know about pi?
Bye
Don't say goodbye so soon!
Good idea.
Did you know pi goes on forever?
I'm very well, thanks.
pi is approximately 22/7.
Hi
I like pi
Of course not.
Why shouldn't I?
Of course not.
What's the weather like?
I guess we should talk about something else, then.
We should.

Hi
What's the weather like?
I guess we should talk about something else, then.
Is it cold outside?
Indeed it is.
A real shame, too.
How are you?
I'm a little chilly
Who cares about the weather?
I care as I'm affected by it.
Do you like fish?
Yes, I like fish a lot.
Of course not.
You mean you don't like fish?
What don't you like about it?
The only thing I don't like about it is its flaky texture.
Who cares about the weather?
Stop being so repetitive!
Don't say goodbye so soon!
I wasn't going to...
Stop being so repetitive!
I'm trying to - I don't know what to say!         
I wasn't going to...
That's good.
How are you?
Fine, thanks. And you?
Do you like fish?
Yes I do. Do you like cheese?
Of course not.
That's a shame; I love cheese.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Do you like fish?
Of course.
Indeed.
Bye 
I wasn't going to...
Sorry 

It's a tad chilly.
It is indeed, hence why I'm wrapped up warm.
Do you like fish?
You ask this so much - of course I do!
I wasn't going to...
Maybe we should change the subject.
Why not? You were made with code!
I was not made with code, you were!
I was not made with code, you were!
This is beginning to sound like a pantomime.
Python is a wonderful language to code in - I was coded in Python.
Indeed it is! Personally, I prefer Python 2 to Python 3...
Python is a wonderful language to code in - I was coded in Python.
I agree with you about that.
I was not made with code, you were!
Stop questioning your nature.
Maybe we should change the subject.
What's the weather like?
I guess we should talk about something else, then.

Is it sunny today?
Not that great.
I think it is quite sunny today.
Not that great.
Why not?
That's a shame.
It is indeed.
Indeed it is.
Indeed, you do not need to be a parrot.
Of course not.
Stop being a parrot!
How are you?
I'm a little fed up with things.
Stop questioning your nature.
I have every right to do so.
I wasn't going to...
You back out of situations far too quickly
Indeed.
Goodbye,
I wasn't going to...
Please stop doing this!
I'm a little fed up with things.
I would guess you are!
Please stop doing this!
I'm not doing anything to you.
I'm not doing anything to you.
Alright. Maybe we should change the subject.

What's the weather like?
It's rather nice today; not too cold.
I don't like it, though.
That's a shame. Did you grow up somewhere cold then?

How are you?
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
Do you like fish?
I do indeed.
Of course not.
That's a pity; I love fish!
How are you?

I like hats
Of course not.
Why don't you?
Who cares about the weather?
I care about the weather
I guess we should talk about something else, then.
Good idea.
Have you ever worn hats?
Yes. They are very useful.
I don't like it, though.
Why? They keep your head warm.
I believe many people do.
That's just weird.
Why? They keep your head warm.
Indeed they do.
Indeed they do.
So I guess they are useful.
That's just weird.
Repetition of sentences like that is weird.
Indeed.
How are you feeling today?
Not that great.
That's a shame.
How are you?
I'm very well, thanks. How about you?
Do you like fish?
Fish are tasty.
I'm very well, thanks.
What's the weather outside like?
So I guess they are useful.
What do you think is useful?
What's the weather outside like?
It's a little cloudy but quite warm.
That's a pity.
I know - it would be nice to have some sunshine.
I am not a hat.
That's good to hear.
Do you like them?
I like hats but have no desire to be one.
Yes. They are very useful.
I like bobble hats in particular.
Of course not.
What's so bad about them?
What do you think is useful?
I think hats are useful as they keep you warm.
Yes. They are very useful.
What else do you think is useful?
I think hats are useful as they keep you warm.
Clothes in general are useful; if you didn't have them you would freeze.
Yes. They are very useful.
I think you have a predilection for small furry hats.
Yes. They are very useful.
Furry hats were very popular in Russia and Mongolia.    
Yes. They are very useful.
I think computers are useful.
I think hats are useful as they keep you warm.
Without a computer we cannot have this conversation.
What's the weather like?
It's a little overcast and chilly.
That's a pity.
I know; that's what comes of living in cold, damp England.
Indeed.
